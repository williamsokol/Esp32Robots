This is the development repo for the source code of BallyBots

You control a BallyBot from website and can move it from anywhere in the world. There are variations on the BallyBot but in essence they are to be interactive robots you can control for fun.

This repo shows the source code for all the BallyBots and is there to help tinkerers modify the BallyBot, and ensuring that nothing intrusive is inside of the internet connected robot.

I have many plans to improve this in my free time and I plan on starting a store to sell the hardware on. It is loosely based on the anybot.
